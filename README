Cross-platform clipboard watching script. In this case it's designed to watch for "www.dropbox.com" links and turn them into "dl.dropbox.com" links. Here's a comparison of the performance difference you can expect when sharing images. Try it yourself and see the difference in load times.

Current settings: 10 threads which each check the clipboard ever 5 seconds. Should give approximately .5 second delay until your clipboard is updated. 

In order to keep this running in the background, I recommend nohup: 

nohup ./clipboard_watcher.py &

Alternatively, you could use the python-daemon package.
